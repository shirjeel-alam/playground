Each subject area then includes more detailed pointers on how to chunk the material, what facts or ideas are\n    most essential, how to solve common exam problems, and the common pitfalls around specific calculations.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    We find these notes are most useful when used in a few ways:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        For cramming and/or last minute overviews of the curriculum\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003eAs a primer or memory retention tool used before or after reading the full material\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo learn how concepts are actually tested including common mistakes and key tricks\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo learn about the core L3 themes and where those themes recur in different readings\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\n    \u003cli\u003e\n        To get common sense explanations of confusing topic areas\n    \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    We all know that there are no shortcuts to learning the material and passing Level 3.

We can also rewrite this\r\n    equation in terms of duration:\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n   \u003cimg width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" src=\"http://gostudy-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/hedge2.png\"/\u003e\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n    The final piece of the puzzle is \u003cem\u003eyield beta. \u003c/em\u003eYield Beta measures the sensitivity to interest rate changes of the CTD bond versus the original\r\n    bond.

The most\n    common cross-hedge example is using a corporate bond futures to hedge a treasury bond.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cstrong\u003e\n        Basically, if the futures contract and the bond have different sensitivities or volatilities we need to account for that in our calculation of how many\n        contracts we need using a hedge ratio.\n    \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cimg width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" src=\"http://gostudy-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/hedge1.png\" /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  \n        The hedge ratio is basically telling us that the number of contracts we need to effectively hedge the underlying bond is a function of the relative\nsensitivity of the bond and futures to a given risk factor.        \u003cstrong\u003eSo if the bond has greater risk exposure than the futures, you would need more futures contracts to fully cover the risk\u003c/strong\u003e.\n  \n    The second equation on the right just adds the conversion factor because the pricing will invariably be in terms of the CTD bond. We can also rewrite this\n    equation in terms of duration:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n   \u003cimg width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" src=\"http://gostudy-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/hedge2.png\" /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    The final piece of the puzzle is \u003cem\u003eyield beta. \u003c/em\u003eYield Beta measures the sensitivity to interest rate changes of the CTD bond versus the original\n    bond. The equation for yield beta is a simple regression:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cimg width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" src=\"http://gostudy-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/hedge3.png\" /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    A yield beta of 1.2 for example would imply that for a yield change of 100 bps on the CTD the underlying bond spread would change 120 bps. Think of this\n    way: if the bond yield has greater volatility than the CTD than more hedges are needed.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    The key takeaway for the exam is that different sensitivities to underlying movements may impact the amount of contracts you need to adequately hedge your\n    exposure. Thus we fold yield beta into our equation to solve for the number of futures contracts:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    \u003cimg width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" src=\"http://gostudy-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/hedge4.png\" /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    Note, on the exam if they don’t include a yield beta then it just = 1. You MUST memorize this last equation.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    To recap we’ve gone through a pretty in-depth walk through of the concepts underlying constructing a hedge ratio and figuring out how many futures\ncontracts we need to hedge a bond position.

The good news? The math is straightforward and with practice you should be able to\r\n        solve these questions quickly and accurately to save time while scoring maximum points. See Question 4 on the 2008 exam for a prime example.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n    Corner portfolios arise in scenarios of \u003cem\u003econstrained optimization. \u003c/em\u003eThis means there are constraints imposed on the portfolio, most notably that\r\n    short selling is not allowed.\u003ca href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e So any given asset classes can have a weighting between 0-100%. The basic\r\n    idea is that in this scenario there are a set of individual portfolios that lie on the efficient frontier. And if you have a portfolio that lies in between\r\ntwo of these efficient corner portfolios, then you can solve for that unknown middle portfolio’s expected return    \u003cu\u003eby taking a weighted average of the expected return of those adjacent corner portfolios.\u003c/u\u003e The same is true for solving for the standard deviation.\r\n    Note the standard deviation you actually solve for will be slightly overstated.\u003ca href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n    For the quants out there, corner portfolios gets around having to use calculus and solving for partial derivatives by assuming that any given small section\r\n    of the efficient frontier is actually a straight line.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n    On the exam the most common way this is tested is as follows:\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n    1.

The Time Commitment of L3 \u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone studying for the CFA allocates a different amount of study time--both in hours spent studying and in the spacing out of those hours. If you've come this far, you already know that despite these differences, the reality is that there are no real shortcuts.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe CFA Institute guidelines suggest that most candidates that pass the exams complete about 300 hours of studying.You could need more or you could need less. The bottom line is that you've come way too far to let insufficient studying derail finishing the CFA exams once and for all. Stay focused and soon you'll be a CFA charter holder! \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003e Creating a Study Plan \u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e So let's talk about breaking down the curriculum into a sensible study plan and then applying timed goals to that plan. In our outlined plan we're taking an \"aggressive\" approach by providing a study plan that spans only four months. We highly recommend extending that time-line out a month or two if you can. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e If you opt for this plan you would need to budget 19 hours a week of studying to hit that 300 hour mark. We are also asking you to cover a lot of study sessions relatively quickly and then spend more time reviewing (rather than being extremely comprehensive on your first pass through of the material). You can condense the order of studying or stretch it out to customize your study plan and learning tendencies.\r\n\r\nWe feel this plan is ambitious yet achievable. The key is discipline and a commitment to maximizing your study hours DURING the week. We recommend this by taking advantage of marginal study time and stealing days to get ahead in areas where you are quite comfortable. You can adjust and manipulate your timeline as you go forward. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003e Best Practices for Reviewing a CFA Study Session \u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e Covering each Study Session involves these recommended steps: \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cbr/\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003e Read our Summary Notes for the given chapter \u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003e Read the Curriculum or Detailed Third Party Notes. Spend more time on sections you're weak in. \u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003e Optional: Create notecards as you read OR use our notecards to sneak in study time while commuting or during coffee breaks at work \u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003e Complete all End of Chapter Questions in the CFA-I curriculum and/or third party notes. Review your answers immediately afterwards. Make a note of the page numbers for these questions and the questions you got wrong or just those that cover very important topics. \u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003e The following week while advancing on new material use your notes, our summary notes, or notecards to hammer the previous week's concepts \u003c/li\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003e Deciding on the order you study the material \u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e We prefer approaching the L3 exam from a portfolio management perspective first as this mirrors the big building blocks of the exam itself. \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e The risk with our approach is covering fixed income, equities, risk management and benchmarking techniques relatively late in the study cycle and then having to spend a lot of cram time on them.

If you've come this far, you already know that despite these differences, the reality is that there are no real shortcuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe CFA Institute guidelines suggest that most candidates that pass the exams complete about 300 hours of studying.You could need more or you could need less. The bottom line is that you've come way too far to let insufficient studying derail finishing the CFA exams once and for all.

In our outlined plan we're taking an \"aggressive\" approach by providing a study plan that spans only four months. We highly recommend extending that time-line out a month or two if you can. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e If you opt for this plan you would need to budget 19 hours a week of studying to hit that 300 hour mark. We are also asking you to cover a lot of study sessions relatively quickly and then spend more time reviewing (rather than being extremely comprehensive on your first pass through of the material). You can condense the order of studying or stretch it out to customize your study plan and learning tendencies.\n\nWe feel this plan is ambitious yet achievable. The key is discipline and a commitment to maximizing your study hours DURING the week. We recommend this by taking advantage of marginal study time and stealing days to get ahead in areas where you are quite comfortable. You can adjust and manipulate your timeline as you go forward. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003e Best Practices for Reviewing a CFA Study Session \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Covering each Study Session involves these recommended steps: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e Read our Summary Notes for the given chapter \u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003e Read the Curriculum or Detailed Third Party Notes.

ID all the benefits (inflows) and costs (outflows)\r\n\t2. Determine the right discount rate to use\r\n\t3. Discount each cash flow using the discount rate. When inputting the cash flows, inflows are positive and outflows            are negative.\r\n\t4. The NPV is the sum of each discounted cash flow (DCF)\r\n\t5. Make a decision on the capital budget project (i.e. is NPV \u003e 0?)\r\n\r\n\r\n__Solving NPV on your financial calculator__\r\n\r\nTo calculate NPV on your financial calculator you need to use the cash flow (CF) function.  Every time you do this on the exam make sure to clear all previous cash flows work by pressing ([CF][2nd][CLR WORK]. **One big key to passing is not to lose points on problems you know the answer to!!**\r\n\r\nNow that you're ready, start by entering all of the sequential cash flows.\r\n\r\n\t* CF0 is in the initial outlay and will be a negative number for a corporate finance project\r\n\t* CF1 is the first period’s cash flow and so on and so forth. Remember to use net cash flows.\r\n\t* When you are done entering the cash flows, hit NPV and enter the interest rate for I=?\r\n\t* Key down and CPT the NPV\r\n\r\n*Solve for IRR using your financial calculator*\r\n\r\nThe steps for entering cash flows are identical to NPV problems. The only difference is that we now hit [IRR][CPT] to calculate the IRR (and of course we are not asked to input an external interest rate).\r\n\r\n## Be able to compare/contrast the use of NPV and IRR, especially when dealing with mutually exclusive projects\r\n\r\nFor a single project NPV and IRR will result in the same decision. Any project with a positive NPV will have an IRR \u003e required rate of return and vice versa *(when NPV = 0, the IRR = the required rate of return).*\r\n\r\nBut when facing mutually exclusive projects, or projects with non-conventional cash flow patterns, NPV and IRR can give conflicting answers.

modifications to consider:\r\n\r\n* Cover the material faster so you have more cram time at the end. This schedule almost assumes the ability to dedicate 10-12 hours of study time per day for those last 10-14 days\r\n* Skip Ethics and GIPS and save it for the end\r\n* Spend less time with Economics and FRA. The key risk in the schedule above is encountering core concepts like Equity Valuation, Fixed Income, and even Derivatives and the newly increased-in-weight Portfolio Management section relatively late in the game\r\n* With limited time you should consider reading 3rd party notes (ours are a supplement not a replacement) instead of the original CFA-I curriculum\r\n* Start mock exams earlier to cover material. Even if you are unfamiliar you'll see problems ahead of encountering the section and be primed to learn them more efficiently","created_at":"2015-12-16T02:46:12.523Z","updated_at":"2015-12-16T02:46:12.523Z","excerpt":"What to cover, in what order, how quickly, and in what manner if you're playing catch-up.","published":true,"html_body":"\u003ch1 id=\"month-cfa-l1-game-plan\"\u003e3 Month CFA L1 Game Plan\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s late September already and despite your best intentions you’ve barely made a dent in the CFA Level 1 material.

Rest assured that its placement at the beginning is not an accident. The lessons in this reading are crucially important to many of the financial calculations throughout the L1 curriculum and often are the last component of solving multiple types of calculations. \r\n\r\nIn this post we'll quickly break down the key takeaways that you should walk away with after reading the section and some of the core testable areas you need to be prepared for on the CFA Level 1 exam.\r\n\r\n### (1) The meaning of interest rates\r\n\r\nWhat is an interest rate?\r\n\r\nBe able to explain that the interest rate can be interpreted as (a) the required rate of return, (b) the discount rate, or (3) as an opportunity cost and be able to define each of those.\r\n\r\n### (2) What components go into determining the interest rate?\r\n\r\nThe interest rate consists of several different risk factors (premiums) that we add up to find the overall interest rate. We usually break these different factors into the (a) risk free rate, (b) inflation, and (c) various other premiums that can include things like illiquidity and security specific factors. In this section the equation we are given is:\r\n\r\n![Components of an interest rate for CFA Level 1](/static/img/Interest-rate-components.png)\r\n\r\nThose different risk premiums explain why the expected rate of return (*you remember that's one way to interpret the interest rate right!?*) varies for different asset classes. \r\n\r\nFinally, while it's only hinted at in this reading, you will eventually also need a good understanding of the difference between the nominal and real interest rates.\r\n\r\n### (3) Compound interest rates and how they link Present Value, and Future Value\r\n\r\nThe concept of present value and future value is essential. You won't get far in the CFA curriculum (or in finance) without understanding that money today is more valuable than money in the future. Exactly how much more valuable is determined by the compound interest rate and the amount of time that passes between now and then. \r\n\r\nThe equation you'll need to memorize for the rest of your CFA life that models this relationship is:\r\n\r\n![Future Value, Present Value, and Compound Interest Rates](/static/img/FV-and-PV.png)\r\n\r\n*If that equation isn't familiar yet go read [this article](https://www.mathsisfun.com/money/compound-interest.html)* \r\n\r\n### (4) Indexing different cash flows to one point in time\r\n\r\nFuture value/present value calculations on the exam will attempt to layer in different levels of complexity into what looks like a basic calculation in order to make a given problem more difficult than a simple formulaic plug and play. \r\n\r\nThe most common way they do this is by requiring you to use the **cash flow additivity principle** to index different future values to a single point in time where they can then be added together. To handle this be confident in using a timeline to determine different net present values and add them up.\r\n\r\nThis becomes especially relevant with problems addressing annuities and annuities due. Practice those types of problems repeatedly. Why? First because they'll be directly tested. Second, because once you have the intuition of when cash flows start and can successfully solve those present value calculations you know you've mastered this reading. \r\n\r\n### (5) Dealing with Different Frequencies of Compounding\r\n\r\n You should be confident taking time periods and converting them to the relevant compounding periods and doing the same with given interest rates. \r\n\r\n*So if a problem gives you the interest rate as an annual number and the time in years, but the loan whose PV you are solving for has quarterly compounding what do you do?* **You would divide r by 4 to get your quarterly interest rate (I/Y) and you would multiply the number of years by 4 to get N.**\r\n\r\nIf you can't perform that type of conversion you'll end up inputting incorrect variables into the formula or your financial calculator and miss a lot of easy points. Plus if you can do that there's also an entire set of equations dealing with different compounding frequencies you can ignore trying to memorize.\r\n\r\n If nothing else always remember that the __higher__ the interest rate or the __more time__ we are taking into consideration the __higher__ the FV of an investment will be.\r\n\r\n### (6) Mastering your Financial Calculator \r\n\r\nThis reading is the first introduction to your financial calculator. Being able to use it across functions will let you circumvent a lot of the formulaic memorization that often plagues L1 Candidates as they grapple with hundreds of different equations. At a bare minimum you should emerge from the EOC questions in this reading being able to toggle between BGN and END and navigating NPV, IRR, and uneven cash flow problems. This will not only up your chances of actually getting specific problems right, but will let you get to other problems more quickly (*and trust us for an exam where you need to answer 1 problem every 90 seconds saving time matters a lot more than you might think*).\r\n\r\n#### Recap\r\n\r\nSo to summarize you need to walk away from the TVM reading knowing:\r\n\r\n* How to interpret an interest rate\r\n* What factors go into determining the interest rate\r\n* How Present Value and Future Value are related\r\n* Bringing multiple cash flows from the future back to today or vice versa\r\n* Dealing with different compounding frequencies and manipulating the interest rate accordingly\r\n* How to use that financial calculator you'll fail without","created_at":"2015-12-16T02:44:56.276Z","updated_at":"2015-12-16T02:44:56.276Z","excerpt":"The most important points from the first reading in Quantitative Methods distilled into five keys.","published":true,"html_body":"\u003ch1 id=\"what-you-need-to-know-after-reading-the-first-chapter-of-quantitative-methods\"\u003eWhat you need to know after Reading the first chapter of Quantitative Methods\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Time Value of Money (TVM) reading kicks off Quantitative Methods.

Makes sense right?\r\n\r\n## Level 1 Topic Weights\r\n\r\nThe exam is broken down into ten different subject areas that cover the basic areas of investment valuation and portfolio management a financial professional is expected to know. \r\n\r\n![CFA Exam Level 1 Topic weights](/static/img/Topic-areas.png)\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, these ten categories fall into four sub-categories: \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Ethics / professional standards\r\n2. Investment tools - Basic framework (quant/econ/international trade/currency)\r\n3. Coverage of individual asset classes\r\n4. Portfolio / wealth management \r\n\r\n### What you need to know to be a Charterholder\r\n\r\nThe L1 topic weights are obviously instructive. But its also helpful to contextualize them relative to what else you're going to need to learn to pass all three levels to earn the Charter. Why? Because the CFA Exam makers know that they have three levels to ensure they completely test your knowledge base, and they'll weight L1 more on areas that don't get tested later.\r\n\r\n*So how do we use this to help prepare for L1?* by the time you're done with the CFA curriculum you need to know (1) how to act, (2) what tools exist to evaluate investment decisions, (3) how to think about and understand all the major asset classes, and (4)how to put all of that together to help a client make the right choices for their portfolio.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the different weights across the different exams, each one tends to emphasize a part of that process. \r\n\r\n**Level 3 is primarily about portfolio management.** It asks you to synthesize all the knowledge you learned in L1/L2 and apply it in a real world context.\r\n\r\n**Level 2 goes really deep into evaluating individual asset classes.** It's the most in-depth and technical when it comes to evaluating / calculating valuations for fixed income, derivatives, and equities. It also challenges Candidates by embedding problems within longer passages. So you need to know not only how to solve a problem, but what information is relevant and what information you can discard.\r\n\r\n**It's no surprise then that Level 1 is a broad introduction to a lot of this material.** You'll need a grasp of the different asset classes and you'll be introduced to different tools and equations to examine each. But you won't go as deep as L2 and you don't need to put concepts together as readily as in L3. Finally, this is testing ground number one to hammer home your ethical responsibilities.\r\n\r\n### Breaking down L1's Key Sections \r\n\r\n**A significant portion of the exam drills into the basic building blocks and tools you need for everything else to make sense.** Without getting to exhaustive, let's go a little deeper on a few of the key areas you need to master.\r\n\r\nEthics is one of these fundamental blocks. \r\n\r\nIt is a HUGE component of L1. Yet despite the 15% weighting, many Candidates understimate the section. You see, Ethics questions appear deceptively simple when they actually take a lot of getting used to. You'll have approximately 36 problems dealing with Ethics. Do plenty of practice problems. Not convinced yet? **In the event you are on the border of pass and fail, your score in Ethics is  used to determine if you should move to Level 2.**\r\n\r\n*Quantitative Methods and Economics are also heavily stressed in L1.* \r\n\r\nYou need a strong grounding in probability and statistics (including regression analysis) to score well in the quantative methods section. Economics can also be quite challenging if you don't have an academic background in it. This section is often really tedious. It has de-railed many good intentions. If you need to, skim this during your first pass.\r\n\r\n*Financial Reporting and Analysis* \r\n\r\nThis is the largest section of L1 and it's also one of the most challenging for most Candidates. Not only that, everything you learn here is vital to getting through L2 as well. Note that Financial reporting has a real mix of both conceptual material and calcuation and ratio heavy material that makes it a lengthy section. There's no alternative but to grind through this material. \r\n\r\n#### What's next\r\n\r\nFrom this high level overview of it's worth reading about the exam format itself (if you're not already familiar). We'll post about that next week.\r\n","created_at":"2015-12-16T02:43:25.889Z","updated_at":"2015-12-16T02:43:38.858Z","excerpt":"A review of L1 topic weights and an explanation of its differences relative to the other two exams.","published":true,"html_body":"\u003ch1 id=\"cfa-level-1-topic-weights-explained-for-20152016\"\u003eCFA Level 1 Topic Weights Explained for 2015/2016\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe could just have easily called this post “How the CFA L1 fits into the overall CFA Curriculum.”That’s because the first part of devising an effective study plan is understanding what you’re expected to know.

There’s a lot of material to cover and life is busy. \r\n\r\nSo, despite our best intentions, it often happens that we find days slipping by without covering any material. *I’ll just read a little extra tomorrow you say to yourself.* And it is true, a few days here and there is OK (in fact, we've long advocated planned zero days). \r\n\r\n## Zero Days Compound\r\nBut putting together multiple zero days has a compounding effect.  \r\n\r\n\r\n1. You get used to not working or covering material. \r\n2. When you do study you try to cram lots of material at once (which is sub-optimal for retention)\r\n3. Perhaps even worse, you start feeling a nervous tension that builds up because you know you're not doing what you need to prepare. \r\n\r\nThe end result is that you're not studying and you're also not enjoying your free time because you feel like you should be. The CFA study process is hard enough without becoming your own worst enemy.\r\n\r\n### The CFA Is a Grind \r\nPassing Level 1 (and then 2 and 3) depends on grinding the material over time. Little habits really do add up. And while everyone will find their own groove, we've been around the block (both ourselves and with hundreds of other Candidates) and we've distilled out a few lessons from that. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Know the basic outline of the material and the ways it is interlinked\r\n\r\nBefore you dive into the weeds you need the thousand foot view. You need to have a general idea of the topics you're going to be expected to learn. \r\n\r\n* How do various topics link together and build on one another? \r\n* What areas are more conceptual and which are calculation heavy? \r\n* What percentage of the exam points are assigned to each topic?  \r\n\r\nKnowing how topics relate to one another helps you chunk material and streamlines your memorization (and it's one of the specialties of our notes). Knowing the topic weights lets you spend your time on the highest leverage topics. That way if you are weak on an area that might only show up in 1-2 questions you can skip it, but if you struggle with fixed income you know you need to drill problems in that area repeatedly. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Understand the perspective of the test makers \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of reasons to undertake the CFA Exam. But we're willing to bet that your number one goal is to PASS. \r\n\r\nWho cares if you've memorized every detail. There's no grade here. You need to score 70% on three exams. Period. To do that, it's helpful to understand what the CFA Institute is asking you to learn for each level, why they might be driving towards that, and how they format the exam to meet their goals. \r\n \r\n \r\n#### Find your Cadence \u0026 Steal Study Time\r\n\r\nWhile Level 1 is often considered the easiest of the CFA exams it comes with an extra wrinkle. Everything is new. \r\n\r\nYou haven’t learned the style of the material and the way it is presented. You haven’t done enough practice problems yet to know how this material can be tested. You don't know exactly what it takes to pass.\r\n\r\nBut that’s OK. You’ll adapt. We’ll provide you a framework for all of it. Before too long you’ll see that the material has a certain cadence to it. It gets easier the more you do it.\r\n\r\nTrust us when we say that incremental marginal improvements can really add up. Your job is to find the right routine.\r\n \r\n \r\n#### Figure out how to Hack the Test\r\n\r\nAs you study you'll get more comfortable with the various topics, your areas of strength and weakness, and the variations of how problems can get tested and how the test takers might try to trick you. \r\n\r\nThat entire process takes time and effort. We like to think that we can help you hack that process by pointing out areas of emphasis, the ways problems have been asked in the past, and the key tricks and tips that will help save you hours and hours of time. \r\n\r\nThen we encode that knowledge in a variety of study tools--notes, a study app, and our newsletter.\r\n \r\n \r\n#### One way to get started is with our free newsletter\r\n\r\nWe're here to help and we're dedicated to that task.
